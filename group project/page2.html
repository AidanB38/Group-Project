            <p>Then the queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with envy. From that hour,
                whenever she looked at snow-white, her heart heaved in her breast, she hated the girl so
                much. And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so that she had
                no peace day or night. She called a huntsman, and said, take the child away into the forest.
                I will no longer have her in my sight. Kill her, and bring me back her lung and liver as a
                token. The huntsman obeyed, and took her away but when he had drawn his knife, and was
                about to pierce snow-whiteâ€™s innocent heart, she began to weep, and said, ah dear huntsman,
                leave me my life. I will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.
            </p>
            <p>
                And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said, run away, then, you poor
                child. The wild beasts will soon have devoured you, thought he, and yet it seemed as if a
                stone had been rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill her. And
                as a young bear just then came running by he stabbed it, and cut out its lung and liver and
                took them to the queen as proof that the child was dead. The cook had to salt them, and
                the wicked queen ate them, and thought she had eaten the lung and liver of snow-white.
            </p>
            <p>But now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so terrified that she looked at all
                the leaves on the trees, and did not know what to do. Then she began to run, and ran over
                sharp stones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm.
            </p>
            <p>She ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening, then she saw a little cottage
                and went into it to rest herself. Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner
                than can be told. There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates,
                and on each plate a little spoon, moreover, there were seven little knives and forks, and seven
                little mugs. Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and covered with snow-white
                counterpanes.
