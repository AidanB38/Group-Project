        <h2>4.1 The cottage</h2>
        <p>Little snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables and bread from
            each plate and drank a drop of wine out of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one
            only. Then, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none of
            them suited her, one was too long, another too short, but at last she found that the seventh
            one was right, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to sleep.

        <h2>4.2 The dwarfs</h2>
        <p>When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back. They were seven dwarfs1 who
            dug and delved in the mountains for ore. They lit their seven candles, and as it was now light
            within the cottage they saw that someone had been there, for everything was not in the same
            order in which they had left it.</p>
