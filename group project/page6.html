            When she heard the mirror speak thus she trembled and
            shook with anger. “Snow-white shall die,” cried she, “though it
            should cost me my own life!” And then she went to a secret lonely
            chamber, where no one was likely to come, and there she made a
            poisonous apple. It was beautiful to look upon, being white with
            red cheeks, so that any one who should see it must long for it, but
            whoever ate even a little bit of it must die. When the apple was
            ready she painted her face and clothed herself like a peasant
            woman, and went across the seven mountains to where the seven
            dwarfs lived. And when she knocked at the door Snowwhite put
            her head out of the window and said, “I dare not let anybody in;
            the seven dwarfs told me not to.” “All right,” answered the
            woman; “I can easily get rid of my apples elsewhere. There, I will
            give you one.” “No,” answered Snow-white, “I dare not take
            anything.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Are you afraid of poison?” said the woman, “look here, I will cut
            the apple in two pieces; you shall have the red side, I will have the
            white one.” For the apple was so cunningly made, that all the
            poison was in the rosy half of it. Snow-white longed for the
            beautiful apple, and as she saw the peasant woman eating a piece
            of it she could no longer refrain, but stretched out her hand and
            took the poisoned half. But no sooner had she taken a morsel of it
            into her mouth than she fell to the earth as dead. And the Queen,
            casting on her a terrible glance, laughed aloud and cried, “As
            white as snow, as red as blood, as black as ebony! This time the
            dwarfs will not be able to bring you to life again.” And when she
            went home and asked the mirror, “Mirror against the
            wall, Who is fairest of us all?" at last it answered, “You are the
            fairest now of all.” Then her envious heart had peace, as much as
            an envious heart can have.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found Snowwhite lying on the ground, and 
            there came no breath out of her mouth, and she was dead.
        </p>
        <p>
            They lifted her up, sought if anything poisonous was to be found,
            cut her laces, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine,
            but all was of no avail, the poor child was dead, and remained
            dead. Then they laid her on a bier, and sat all seven of them round
            it, and wept and lamented three whole days. And then they would
            have buried her, but that she looked still as if she were living, with
            her beautiful blooming cheeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            So they said, “We cannot hide her away in the black ground.” And
            they had made a coffin of clear glass, so as to be looked into from
            all sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote in golden letters upon it
            her name, and that she was a King’s daughter. Then they set the
            coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always remained by it to watch. 
            And the birds came too, and mourned for Snowwhite, first an owl, then a raven, and lastly, a dove.
            Now, for a long while Snow-white lay in the coffin and never
            changed, but looked as if she were asleep, for she was still as white
            as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony.
