            It happened, however, that one day a King’s son rode through the
            wood and up to the dwarfs’ house, which was near it. He saw on
            the mountain the coffin, and beautiful Snow-white within it, and
            he read what was written in golden letters upon it. Then he said to
            the dwarfs, “Let me have the coffin, and I will give you whatever
            you like to ask for it.” But the dwarfs told him that they could not
            part with it for all the gold in the world. But he said, “I beseech
            you to give it me, for I cannot live without looking upon Snowwhite; if you consent I will bring you to great honor, and care for
            you as if you were my brethren.”

            When he so spoke the good little dwarfs had pity upon him and
            gave him the coffin, and the King’s son called his servants and bid
            them carry it away on their shoulders. Now it happened that as
            they were going along they stumbled over a bush, and with the
            shaking the bit of poisoned apple flew out of her throat. It was not
            long before she opened her eyes, threw up the cover of the coffin,
            and sat up, alive and well.

            “Oh dear! where am I?” cried she. The King’s son answered, full of
            joy, “You are near me,” and, relating all that had happened, he
            said, “I would rather have you than anything in the world; come
            with me to my father’s castle and you shall be my bride.” And
            Snow-white was kind, and went with him, and their wedding was
            held with pomp and great splendor.

            But Snow-white’s wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast,
            and when she had dressed herself in beautiful clothes she went to
            her looking-glass and said, “Looking-glass upon the wall, Who is
            fairest of us all?"

            The looking-glass answered, “O Queen, although you are of beauty
            rare, The young bride is a thousand times more fair."
            Then she railed and cursed, and was beside herself with
            disappointment and anger. First she thought she would not go to
            the wedding; but then she felt she should have no peace until she
            went and saw the bride. And when she saw her she knew her for
            Snow-white, and could not stir from the place for anger and terror.
            
            For they had ready red-hot iron shoes, in which she had to dance
            until she fell down dead.
