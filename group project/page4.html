           After resolving to teach the dwarves to read they danced the night away while some one else as 
           geing ready to party the night away, but she would have to have her hopes dashed. The Queen walked up to the 
           mirror with confidence and asked the magic mirror "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" 
           as if she already knew the answer she began to smirk before it was wiped away just as quick as it appeared as th mirror began to speak
           "You, my Queen, are fair, that is true
           But Snow White, beyond the mountains
           with the seven dwarves, 
           Is still a thousand times fairer than you."  “That’s impossible!” screamed the Queen.  
           “The girl is no longer alive!” “Snow White lives.” said the Magic Mirror.  And an image was shown on the mirror 
           of Snow White living in the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. The Queen turned red with rage.  She screamed, 
           “Who does she think she is?!  Snow White will not get away with this!” At the cottage of the Dwarfs the 
           next afternoon, when the Seven Dwarfs were away at work, there was a knock on the door. “Who is it?” said 
           Snow White.  She remembered the warning of the Seven Dwarfs not to open the door to anyone. “It’s only a 
           poor old woman,” came a squeaky voice, “selling lace.” Yet it was the evil Queen, disguised as an old woman. 
            “I know all travelers in these woods must have worn shoes,” said her voice through the door.  
            “Please let me in and show you how my lace will make your shoes tighter than new!” Snow White looked down
            and saw the state of her shoes after her journey from the castle to the cottage and thought she could use new 
            lace "Alright may come in." as she opened the door, the Queen gives Snow White the magical lace she got from the kings
            treasureury and commands it to choke Snow White.
