        <!--from this silde froward the story will be done by D'Angelo, this will be the start of the assination attempts-->
        <p>
            “With all my heart,” said Snow-white; and so she stayed, and kept
            the house in good order. In the morning the dwarfs went to the
            mountain to dig for gold; in the evening they came home, and their
            supper had to be ready for them. All the day long the maiden was
            left alone, and the good little dwarfs warned her, saying, “Beware
            of your step-mother, she will soon know you are here. Let no one
            into the house.” Now the Queen, having eaten Snow-white’s heart,
            as she supposed, felt quite sure that now she was the first and
            fairest, and so she came to her mirror, and said,
        </p>
        <p>    
            “Mirror upon the wall, Who is fairest of us all?"
            And the mirror answered,
            “Queen, thou art of beauty rare, But Snow-white living in the glen
            With the seven little men Is a thousand times more fair."
        </p>
        <p>
            Then she was very angry, for the mirror always spoke the truth, and
            she knew that the huntsman must have deceived her, and that
            Snow-white must still be living. And she thought and thought how
            she could manage to make an end of her, for as long as she was not
            the fairest in the land, envy left her no rest. At last she thought of a
            plan; she painted her face and dressed herself like an old peddler
            woman, so that no one would have known her. In this disguise she
            went across the seven mountains, until she came to the house of the
            seven little dwarfs, and she knocked at the door and cried, “Fine
            wares to sell! fine wares to sell!” Snow-white peeped out of the
            window and cried, “Good-day, good woman, what have you to
            sell?” “Good wares, fine wares,” answered she, “corset of all
            colors”; and she held up a piece that was woven of variegated silk.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I need not be afraid of letting in this good woman,” thought
            Snow-white, and she unbarred the door and bought the pretty lace.
        </p>
        <p>
            “What a figure you are, child!” said the old woman, “come and let
            me lace you properly for once.” Snow-white, suspecting nothing,
            stood up before her, and let her lace her with the new corset; but the
            old woman laced so quickly and tightly that it took Snowwhite’s
            breath away, and she fell down as dead.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Now you have done with being the fairest,” said the old woman
            as she hastened away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not long after that, towards evening, the seven dwarfs came home,
            and were terrified to see their dear Snow-white lying on the
            ground, without life or motion; they raised her up, and when they
            saw how tightly she was laced they cut the corset in two; then she
            began to draw breath, and little by little she returned to life.
