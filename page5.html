        <h2>5.2 Second Attempt</h2>
        <p>
            When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, “The old
            peddler woman was no other than the wicked Queen; you must
            beware of letting any one in when we are not here!” And when the
            wicked woman got home she went to her mirror and said, 
            “Mirror against the wall, Who is fairest of us all?"
        </p>
        <p>
            And it answered as before, “Queen, thou art of beauty rare, But
            Snow-white living in the glen With the seven little men Is a
            thousand times more fair."
            When she heard that she was so struck with surprise that all the
            blood left her heart, for she knew that Snow-white must still be
            living.

        <p>
            “But now,” said she, “I will think of something that will be her
            ruin.” And by witchcraft she made a poisoned comb. Then she
            dressed herself up to look like another different sort of old woman.
            So she went across the seven mountains and came to the house of
            the seven dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried, “Good wares
            to sell! good wares to sell!” Snow-white looked out and said, “Go
            away, I must not let anybody in.” “But you are not forbidden to
            look,” said the old woman, taking out the poisoned comb and
            holding it up. It pleased the poor child so much that she was
            tempted to open the door; and when the bargain was made the old
            woman said, “Now, for once, your hair shall be properly combed.”
            Poor Snow-white, thinking no harm, let the old woman do as she
            would, but no sooner was the comb put in her hair than the poison
            began to work, and the poor girl fell down senseless.
        </p>    
        <p>
            “Now, you paragon of beauty,” said the wicked woman, “this is
            the end of you,” and went off. By good luck it was now near
            evening, and the seven little dwarfs came home. When they saw
            Snow-white lying on the ground as dead, they thought directly
            that it was the step-mother’s doing, and looked about, found the
            poisoned comb, and no sooner had they drawn it out of her hair
            than Snow-white came to herself, and related all that had passed.
            Then they warned her once more to be on her guard, and never
            again to let any one in at the door.

            And the Queen went home and stood before the looking-glass and
            said, “Mirror against the wall, Who is fairest of us all?"
            And the mirror answered as before,
            “Queen, thou art of beauty rare, But Snow-white living in the glen
            With the seven little men Is a thousand times more fair."
